A flowchart is a graphical representation of a process, system, or algorithm using various symbols, arrows, and connecting lines to illustrate the sequence of steps or actions. It is a visual tool that helps to depict the logical flow of information, decision points, and actions within a complex system or process.

Flowcharts are widely used in various fields, including software development, engineering, business analysis, project management, and education. They provide a clear and structured way to visualize the different stages of a process, the decision-making points, and the relationships between different components.

In a flowchart, different shapes represent different elements:

Rectangles: These represent process steps or actions.
Diamonds: These represent decision points where a choice needs to be made.
Ovals: These represent the start or end points of the flowchart.
Arrows: These indicate the flow and direction of the process, showing how one step leads to another.
